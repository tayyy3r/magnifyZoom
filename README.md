# magnifyZoom
jQuery Image Magnifier Project

Project was created to practice jQuery API to showcase animation capabilities, as well implementing logic for a magnifying glass application. 
The basic idea behind this project is to provide two images, one high resolution and one low, in order to allow for a magnification type experience.
The lower resolution image will load onto the page, and when the user hovers over it a magnifying glass will appear below their cursor. 
The image that appears underneath the magnifying glass is not rescaled or magnified as it were, but simply shows the higher resolution image supplied.
This is accomplished by determining offsets and coordinates and showing appropriate area of the high resolution image within the area of the glass. 

Instructions:

-Unzip file in desired location
(!IMPORTANT!)
Do not change file structure of unzipped project, or rename files. This will break the application.

-Hover mouse over image to see magnified image appear under "looking glass".
